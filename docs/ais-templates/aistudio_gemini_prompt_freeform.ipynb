A dependency graph with diamond dependency may then end up in having the same .so file specified in CcSharedLibraryInfo.linker_input from multiple targets.\\n\\nConsider the following example:\\n\\ncc_import X\\ncc_shared_library A depends on X\\ncc_shared_library B depends on X\\ncc_binary top depends on A and B\\nWhen linking top, the link order top.a, A.so, X.so, B.so is produced and wrong. When B depends on X, X.so should be placed behind B.so. The wanted link order is top.a, A.so, B.so, X.so.\\n\\ncc_shared_library.bzl contains the following code:\\n\\n        CcSharedLibraryInfo(\\n            dynamic_deps = merged_cc_shared_library_infos,\\n            exports = exports.keys(),\\n            link_once_static_libs = curr_link_once_static_libs_set,\\n            linker_input = cc_common.create_linker_input(\\n                owner = ctx.label,\\n                libraries = depset([linking_outputs.library_to_link] + precompiled_only_dynamic_libraries),\\n            ),\\n        ),\\nThis will create a single LinkerInput with all the .so files. When multiple LinkerInputs are put in a depset, the ordering of the individual .so files in the LinkerInput.libraries field will not change. On the contrary, cc_library produces multiple LinkerInputs with one .so file in each. In that case, the depset is able to reorder them on a higher level in the dependency graph.\\n\\nThis problem can (hopefully) be solved if CcSharedLibraryInfo.linker_input is changed into CcSharedLibraryInfo.linker_inputs where each LinkerInput contains a single LibraryToLink.\\\"\",\n",

This makes a lot of sense for transitions that intentionally flip a small handful of flags, and is critical for some tasks. For transitions on a platform, though, this behavior is less desirable. A platform specifies constraints and flags that define a configuration that will support the target platform. When writing a platform, the author has to make some assumptions about any unmentioned flags. Today, it's difficult to reason about the exact incoming configuration when a transition occurs, which means that it's entirely possible for a platform to be misconfigured due to the incoming configuration state.\\n\\n\\\"\",\n",
